Repo for the code and material used to design the Learn Prompt Engineering website and course. Everything below the line was generated using ChatGPT, May 12 Version. My intent is to create a prompt engineering website and course using information obtained and generated by ChatGPT, and to include all of the prompts I used for transparency and interest. I started this repo with the following prompts:

- How do I create a webpage using Git and Github (only free resources) that points to a personal domain I own through GoDaddy?
- When I open my terminal, it's set to `zsh`. Is that what I want to use?
- Should I choose a `.gitignore` template?
